## Why DevTrack?

Most developers track their work across multiple disconnected tools — GitHub for commits, Jira for tasks, Notion for goals, Slack for standups. None of them give you the full picture.

**DevTrack solves this by:**

- Consolidating GitHub contributions, PR metrics, and streak data in one view
- Helping you set and visualize personal coding goals with progress tracking
- Keeping your data yours — fully self-hostable with zero vendor lock-in
- Deploying in minutes on the free tier of Next.js + Supabase + Vercel

## Architecture

New contributors can start with the [architecture overview](./docs/architecture.md) for Mermaid diagrams covering the Next.js frontend, API routes, Supabase schema, external services, and GitHub activity sync flow.

---

## API Documentation

DevTrack includes a documented REST API.

Documentation resources:

- `docs/api.md` — API usage guide
- `public/openapi.yaml` — OpenAPI 3.1 specification
- `/api-docs` — Interactive Swagger UI

After starting the development server, open:

`http://localhost:3000/api-docs`

---

## Getting Started

For local development and contributing, see **[DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md)**.
To deploy your own instance, see the **[Self-Hosting Guide](./docs/self-hosting.md)**.


### Quick Start

**1. Clone and install**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Priyanshu-byte-coder/devtrack.git
cd devtrack
pnpm install
```

**2. Set up Supabase**

1. Create a free project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Run all migrations from `supabase/migrations/` in the SQL editor (in order)
3. Copy your Project URL, anon key, and service_role key from **Project Settings → API**

**3. Create a GitHub OAuth App**

1. Go to [GitHub → Settings → Developer Settings → OAuth Apps](https://github.com/settings/applications/new)
2. Set the callback URL to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`
3. Copy your Client ID and Client Secret

**4. Configure environment**

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

### Environment Variables

> [!WARNING]
> Never commit `.env` or `.env.local` to Git. These files are pre-configured in `.gitignore`.

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Yes | Supabase project URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Yes | Supabase public anon key |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Yes | Supabase service role key (server-side only) |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | Yes | Base URL of the app (`http://localhost:3000` locally) |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | Yes | Session encryption key — `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `GITHUB_ID` | Yes | GitHub OAuth App Client ID |
| `GITHUB_SECRET` | Yes | GitHub OAuth App Client Secret |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Yes | 32-byte hex key — `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | No | Personal Access Token to raise GitHub API rate limits |
| `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | No | Webhook signature validation key |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` | No | Upstash Redis endpoint for rate limiting |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` | No | Upstash Redis access token |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | No | Groq API key for AI weekly insights |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | No | Public URL override for generating share links |

**5. Run locally**

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and sign in with GitHub.

**6. Run tests**

```bash
# Unit tests
pnpm test

# End-to-end tests (requires Chromium)
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
pnpm run test:e2e
```

### E2E Test Suite (Playwright)

DevTrack ships a Playwright-based end-to-end suite covering the full user journey — OAuth sign-in, dashboard rendering, and API correctness. No real credentials needed; all external calls are mocked via `page.route()`.

| Spec file | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| `e2e/auth.spec.ts` | Landing page, sign-in button, OAuth redirect, unauthenticated redirects |
| `e2e/dashboard.spec.ts` | All 6 dashboard widgets render after mock login, no console errors |
| `e2e/goals.spec.ts` | Goal create/delete lifecycle with API payload verification |
| `e2e/streak.spec.ts` | Streak values display, freeze button triggers API call |
| `e2e/api.spec.ts` | Auth-gated API routes return 200/401 correctly |

```bash
# Install Playwright browsers (one-time)
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium

# Run the full suite (dev server auto-starts on port 3002)
pnpm run test:e2e

# Run a single spec
npx playwright test e2e/goals.spec.ts

# Interactive UI runner
npx playwright test --ui
```

The test server is configured in `playwright.config.mjs` and auto-starts on `http://127.0.0.1:3002` with placeholder credentials — no `.env.local` required. E2E tests also run on every PR via `.github/workflows/e2e.yml`.

### Visual Regression Tests

Playwright screenshot assertions cover the landing page, sign-in page, dashboard header, public profile, and 404 page.

```bash
# Run visual regression tests
npx playwright test -c playwright.visual.config.mjs

# Update baselines
npx playwright test -c playwright.visual.config.mjs --update-snapshots
```

Baselines are stored in `tests/snapshots/`. Use the same Linux/Chromium environment as CI to avoid OS-specific rendering differences. The suite uses a `1280x720` viewport and fails at >0.1% pixel difference.

---

## Docker Development Setup

DevTrack includes Docker support for local development, allowing contributors to get started quickly without manually installing dependencies or configuring environments.

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop (Windows/macOS) or Docker Engine (Linux)
- Docker Compose v2+

Verify installation:

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

### Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Fill in the required values as described in the Environment Variables section above.

### Start the Application

Build and start the development container:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The application will be available at:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

### Stop the Application

```bash
docker compose down
```

### Hot Reload Support

The project source code is mounted into the container using Docker volumes.

Any changes made to files on your host machine are automatically reflected inside the container, enabling Next.js hot reload during development without rebuilding the image.

### Rebuild After Dependency Changes

If you modify `package.json` or install new dependencies:

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up --build
```

### Troubleshooting

Remove containers and rebuild from scratch:

```bash
docker compose down -v
docker compose up --build
```

View container logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

## FAQ

Answers to questions new contributors and self-hosters ask most often. For deeper setup detail, see [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md) and the [Self-Hosting Guide](./docs/self-hosting.md).

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I configure GitHub OAuth?</strong></summary>

1. Go to [GitHub → Settings → Developer Settings → OAuth Apps](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) and create a new OAuth App.
2. Set the **Authorization callback URL** to:
   - Local dev: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`
   - Production: `https://<your-domain>/api/auth/callback/github`
3. Copy the generated **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into `GITHUB_ID` and `GITHUB_SECRET` in `.env.local`.
4. Make sure `NEXTAUTH_URL` matches the base URL you're running on, and `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is set (generate one with `openssl rand -base64 32`).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why is login not working?</strong></summary>

This is almost always one of the following:

- **Callback URL mismatch** — the URL registered on your GitHub OAuth App must exactly match `NEXTAUTH_URL` + `/api/auth/callback/github`, including protocol and trailing slashes.
- **Missing/incorrect `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`** — sessions will silently fail without it.
- **Stale `.env.local`** — restart `pnpm dev` after changing any auth-related env vars; Next.js doesn't hot-reload env files.
- **Supabase RLS blocking the user row** — check that the relevant migrations from `supabase/migrations/` have been applied in order.

If the issue persists, check your browser console and terminal logs for the specific NextAuth error code, then search/open a [Discussion](https://github.com/Priyanshu-byte-coder/devtrack/discussions).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I obtain Supabase credentials?</strong></summary>

1. Create a free project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. Open **Project Settings → API**.
3. Copy:
   - **Project URL** → `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - **anon public key** → `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - **service_role key** → `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (server-side only — never expose this in client code or commit it)
4. Run all SQL files in `supabase/migrations/` via the Supabase SQL editor, in order, before starting the app.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why are GitHub metrics not loading?</strong></summary>

- You're likely hitting **GitHub's unauthenticated API rate limit**. Set the optional `GITHUB_TOKEN` (a personal access token) in `.env.local` to raise the limit significantly.
- Check that your GitHub OAuth scopes were granted during sign-in — if you denied a permission, re-authenticate by signing out and back in.
- If you're self-hosting behind a proxy or firewall, confirm outbound requests to `api.github.com` aren't being blocked.
- Look at the server logs/terminal for the specific API error (403 usually means rate-limited; 401 means a token problem).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I run tests?</strong></summary>

```bash
# Unit tests
pnpm test

# End-to-end tests (Playwright, first-time setup)
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
pnpm run test:e2e

# Run a single e2e spec
npx playwright test e2e/goals.spec.ts

# Visual regression tests
npx playwright test -c playwright.visual.config.mjs
```

E2E tests use mocked external calls (no real GitHub/Supabase credentials needed) and also run automatically on every PR via `.github/workflows/e2e.yml`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How can I contribute?</strong></summary>

1. Browse [open issues](https://github.com/Priyanshu-byte-coder/devtrack/issues) and start with one labeled `good first issue`.
2. Comment on the issue to get assigned before starting work.
3. Fork the repo, branch off `main` (e.g. `feat/issue-42-description`), and open a PR.
4. Before pushing, make sure CI passes locally:
   ```bash
   pnpm run lint && pnpm run type-check
   ```
5. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for commit message style, branch naming conventions, and the review process.

Questions are welcome anytime in [Discussions](https://github.com/Priyanshu-byte-coder/devtrack/discussions).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Which Node.js and pnpm versions are supported?</strong></summary>

| Tool | Version | Check |
|------|---------|-------|
| Node.js | >= 20 | `node -v` |
| pnpm | >= 9 | `pnpm -v` |
| Git | any | `git --version` |

Install pnpm via `corepack enable` or `npm install -g pnpm` if you don't already have it.

If your local versions differ and you hit install/build errors, aligning your Node.js/pnpm version with the table above is the first thing to check.

</details>
